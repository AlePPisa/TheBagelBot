# The Bagel Bot
The project started as a random idea to implement a Discord Bot to our personal server. The idea consisted in implementing the [Discord API][Di] using [Python][Py] to create a BOT that could potentially order pizza for us, search the web, send us memes from [Reddit][Re], along with several silly games for the chat such as the Magic 8Ball and Russian Roulette.

# The Commands

> -search

> -8ball

> -reddit

> Rusian Roulette Commands:
> 
> \- ready up
>
> \- shoot
>
> \-restart

> -nudes
